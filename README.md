This repository contains the firmware, dataset, and attestation codes used in our paper `Swarm-Net: Firmware Attestation in IoT Swarms using Graph Neural Networks and Volatile Memory` submitted to the IEEE IoT Journal. Our dataset [`IoT Swarm SRAM Dataset for Firmware Attestation`](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/gmee-vj41) is available on IEEE Dataport. 

If you would like to use this work, kindly cite our preprint and dataset using their respective BibTeX:

`Preprint`
